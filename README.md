-   low-level
-   performance: TODO

## usage

see [examples](./examples), but basically just

```c++
#include "tui.hpp"

-   for fun

## non-goals

-   [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs): Rust and the name speak for itself, uses crossterm

-   [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI): pretty awesome indeed
-   [imtui](https://github.com/ggerganov/imtui): this guy is a c++ wizard
-   [tvision](https://github.com/magiblot/tvision): not bad
-   [finalcut](https://github.com/gansm/finalcut): super
-   [TermOx](https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/TermOx): astonishing
-   [AppCUI](https://github.com/gdt050579/AppCUI): wasn't built in a week for sure
